## Diego Rodriguez
Backend Engineer focused on scalable APIs, authentication systems and infrastructure-aware application design.

I build production-style backend systems using Node.js/NestJS with strong emphasis on:
- Authentication & session management (cookies, refresh tokens, RBAC)
- Transactional data integrity and database design
- Caching strategies and rate limiting with Redis
- Containerized environments (Docker) and local Kubernetes deployments
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e) and CI workflows

I also have a C++ background, which strengthened my understanding of memory management, data structures and low-level system design.
